Shop Vac Adapters
==================

Adapters to fit the hose of Rigid shop vacuum to a few tools and another to fit drill press.

## Dewalt DWS780 Saw
This comes with a dust collection bag that sits at the end of tube behind the saw. It doesn't collect very much dust, so I thought I would hook a shop vac to it. The design is really simple, just adapting two different inside diameters.


## WEN 4214 Drill Press
It doesn't have a dust collection point, so I just used hollow stem of the table. I order to get the some clearance for the hose when attached, I added an 55deg elbow. I Surprsingly, this printed ok without supports in PLA on a Prusa MK3S, but it is  marginal. On my grey PLA the surface was perfect. One the black PLA, the bottom showed some sagging, but sitll held together well enough to fit where I needed.

This was my first time using the sweep tool in Fusion 360, I used it to make the 55deg elbow.
